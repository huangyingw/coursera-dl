Auto CAUTH authentication?

I noticed coursera-dl support manually provide CAUTH authentication with -ca option.
But this requere manually copy from say, chrome console.
Could we make it automatic ?

The answer is most probably YES.

I use mac, the Cookie file for my chrome is ~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/Cookies
I did some investigation, and some codes, but still no luck, could anyone help me with this?
