Auto CAUTH authentication?

I noticed coursera-dl support manually provide CAUTH authentication with -ca option.
And this option indeed works well.

Except that this is incovenient, always need to manually copy from say, chrome console.
Could we make it automatic ?

The answer is most probably YES.
I did some investigation, and some codes, but still no luck, could anyone help me with this?

I use mac, the Cookie file for my chrome is ~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/Cookies, this is just a sql lite database.

I used SQLiteStudio to query, with sql 'select name, encrypted_value from cookies where host_key like "%coursera.org" and name == "CAUTH"'
I could indeed get the encrypted_value of CAUTH, and pass this value to cookies to authenticate, but fail.

I tried decode it to str with 
str(encrypted_value, 'utf-8')
but get
UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0xe6 in position

But if I just bytes to str with 
str(encrypted_value)

I got following error:
Error 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://api.coursera.org/api/memberships.v1?includes=courseId,courses.v1&q=me&showHidden=true&filter=current,preEnrolled getting page https://api.coursera.org/api/memberships.v1?includes=courseId,courses.v1&q=me&showHidden=true&filter=current,preEnrolled
The server replied: {"errorCode":"Not Authorized","message":null,"details":null}
HTTPError 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://api.coursera.org/api/memberships.v1?includes=courseId,courses.v1&q=me&showHidden=true&filter=current,preEnrolled
I tested this with a free course: machine-learning, so I think it is not membership(not paid) issue, only and still authentication failure.


Bellow is my change to coursera/coursera_dl.py file
